# Pascal's Triangle
## Algorithm   Python

This directory contains a solution for generating Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Task Description
The task is to write a program that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. The program should take an input parameter numRows that specifies the number of rows to generate.

Implementation
The solution for generating Pascal's Triangle is implemented in the file pascal_triangle.py. It is a Python script that takes an input numRows and prints the Pascal's Triangle up to the specified number of rows.

The script uses nested loops to calculate the values of each cell in the triangle based on the values of the cells above it. The resulting triangle is then printed to the console.
